1) Verify that OpenGL vsync is on and that the refresh rate is correctly set to
120 Hz. Sometimes it stays at 60 Hz until you open the NVIDIA settings
(System > Preferences > NVIDIA X Server Settings), at which point it pops up
to 120 Hz. If you have vsync on you can run glxgears to verify the refresh
rate.

2) Verify that you are not using any special window compositor (i.e. Compiz).
You must use the default (Metacity).

3) The USB emitter device must have permissions that grant regular users write
access, otherwise you'll need to run your program as root. (Admistrators can
configure this by copying the 98-nvstusb.rules file into /etc/udev/rules.d/

4) Ensure that you have the USB emitter firmware (nvstusb.fw) in your current
working directory (probably the same as your executable).


Requires:
    libusb-1.0



=====

In nvidia-settings...

Select the DFP display under the GPU, and disable Force Full GPU Scaling.
It *must* be disabled for you to go higher than 60 Hz. Next, go back to the
X Server Display Configuration Tab and select a specific resolution and
120 Hz refresh rate. Run nvidia-settings as root to save it to xorg.conf.
Run glxgears with vsync on to verify.
